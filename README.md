### Hi everyone! 👋

Carly Richmond here! I am a Developer Advocate at Elastic 🥑, Frontend engineer, UX enthusiast and Agile advocate. Prior to joining Elastic I worked in financial services for over 10 years, in a mixture of roles including Senior Frontend Engineer, Tech Lead, People Manager and Agile Coach.

Tech wise I am dabbling in React and the Elastic Product suite. Historically I've focused on Angular, Cypress and the usual web stuff. But I love learning new technologies and do that as much as I can. Especially since I moved from Desktop UI to Web UI development severak years ago.

I loves learning, supporting and mentoring other developers. In my spare time I share my development experiences and lessons in the pursuit of inspiring other to build impactful software in a better way. You can check out my musings [on my personal blog,](https://carlyrichmond.com/blog-home/) [and through my talks](https://carlyrichmond.com/talks/).

Outside of technology, I loves photography 📸, cooking 🥘 and drinking a lot of tea ☕🍵!

Do get in touch if you would like to chat! I'm always happy to chat via DM on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carly-richmond-b4b03563/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CarlyLRichmond).
